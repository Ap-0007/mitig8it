"""Repair families: which one a finding belongs to, and what its regression test must assert.

The engine uses the family to decide support; the agent loop names it in the task prompt and in
a coverage revision, with the harness assertion that proves a repair of that family, so the
model never has to infer either from the scanner's wording.

A family is language-independent: the same CWE-89 finding is `sql_parameterization` in a Node
router and in a Flask view. What differs per language is the toolchain (Node or Python) and the
harness assertion, so both are looked up by the affected file's language.
