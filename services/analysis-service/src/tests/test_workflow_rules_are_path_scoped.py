"""A workflow rule must be scoped to `.github/workflows/`, and nothing wider.

`workflow_coverage.yml` is the second `generic` rule file, and `generic` is token matching
with no notion of a language, so a rule with no `paths: include` reads every file in the
batch. The template rules solved that with an extension glob. These cannot: `.yml` is the
most common configuration extension there is, and `run:`, `ref:` and `permissions:` all mean
something else in a compose file, a Kubernetes manifest, an Ansible playbook or another
provider's CI config. An include of `*.yml` would therefore be a rule set that fires on
configuration it makes no claim about.

So the scope is asserted twice, once as the literal and once as behaviour:

* every rule includes exactly the two workflow globs and nothing else;
* the rules, run through the real scanner over a tree that contains both a workflow and
  ordinary YAML with the same tokens in it, fire only on the workflow.

The second is the one that would catch a scanner whose glob semantics changed under us.
