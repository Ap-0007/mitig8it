"""The tier 2 precision benchmark: every posting rule fires on its own fixture, and the
lines a rule was narrowed away from stay silent.

A rule that posts is a claim about real code, and the claim decays. A pattern edited to
remove a false positive can remove the true positive with it, and nothing else in the suite
would notice: the replay is not run in CI and a rule that has stopped matching produces no
failure, only silence. `benchmarks/tier2-precision/cases.json` turns that silence into a
failing test.

Every fixture is scanned in one scanner pass, because a pass costs a second and there are
ninety of them.
